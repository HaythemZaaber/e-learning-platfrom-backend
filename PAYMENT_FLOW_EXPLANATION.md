# üí≥ Live Session Payment Flow Complete Guide

## **üéØ Overview**

The live session payment system uses **Stripe Connect** with **manual capture** to ensure:

1. **Student pays immediately** when booking
2. **Money is held** by the platform until session completion
3. **Instructor gets paid** only after session is marked as complete
4. **Platform takes a fee** from each transaction

## **üîÑ Step-by-Step Payment Flow**

### **Step 1: Student Books Session**

```
Student ‚Üí Books Time Slot ‚Üí Creates Booking Request
```

**What happens:**

- Student selects available time slot
- System creates `BookingRequest` with `PENDING` status
- System creates `PaymentIntent` with `manual_capture`
- Student pays immediately via Stripe Checkout
- Payment is **authorized but not captured**

### **Step 2: Payment Authorization**

```
Stripe ‚Üí Authorizes Payment ‚Üí Holds Money
```

**Payment Intent State:** `requires_capture`

- Money is **authorized** (held by Stripe)
- **Not yet transferred** to instructor
- Student's card is charged but can be refunded
- Platform holds the money temporarily

### **Step 3: Session Confirmation**

```
Instructor ‚Üí Approves Booking ‚Üí Creates Live Session
```

**What happens:**

- Instructor approves the booking
- System creates `LiveSession` record
- `BookingRequest` status becomes `ACCEPTED`
- Payment remains **authorized but not captured**

### **Step 4: Session Execution**

```
Instructor + Student ‚Üí Conduct Live Session
```

**What happens:**

- Session takes place via Jitsi
- Both parties participate
- Session is recorded (if enabled)
- No payment movement yet

### **Step 5: Session Completion**

```
Instructor ‚Üí Marks Session Complete ‚Üí Captures Payment
```

**What happens:**

- Instructor marks session as `COMPLETED`
- System **captures the payment** (transfers money)
- Money moves from platform to instructor's Stripe account
- Platform fee is deducted automatically
- `PaymentIntent` state becomes `succeeded`

### **Step 6: Payout Processing**

```
Stripe ‚Üí Transfers Money ‚Üí Instructor's Bank Account
```

**What happens:**

- Instructor's Stripe account receives the payment
- Money is automatically transferred to instructor's bank account
- Platform fee remains in platform's account

## **üí∞ Payment Breakdown Example**

### **Session Price: $100**

```
Student Payment: $100
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Platform Fee (20%): $20
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Instructor Payout (80%): $80
```

### **Flow:**

1. **Student pays:** $100 to platform
2. **Platform holds:** $100 (authorized)
3. **Session completes:** Platform captures $100
4. **Platform keeps:** $20 (fee)
5. **Instructor receives:** $80 (via Stripe Connect)

## **üîß Technical Implementation**

### **Payment Intent Creation**

```typescript
const paymentIntent = await stripe.paymentIntents.create({
  amount: 10000, // $100.00 in cents
  currency: 'usd',
  application_fee_amount: 2000, // $20.00 platform fee
  transfer_data: {
    destination: instructorStripeAccountId, // Where money goes
  },
  capture_method: 'manual', // Don't capture immediately
  metadata: {
    bookingRequestId: 'booking_123',
    sessionType: 'LIVE_SESSION',
  },
});
```

### **Payment Capture**

```typescript
const capturedPayment = await stripe.paymentIntents.capture(paymentIntentId, {
  amount_to_capture: 10000, // Capture the full amount
});
```

## **üìä Database Records**

### **BookingRequest**

```typescript
{
  id: 'booking_123',
  status: 'ACCEPTED',
  paymentStatus: 'PENDING', // Until captured
  paymentIntentId: 'pi_1234567890',
  finalPrice: 100,
  currency: 'USD'
}
```

### **LiveSession**
